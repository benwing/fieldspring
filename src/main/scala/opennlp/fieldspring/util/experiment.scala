   *    appropriate parameters. Set `params` to this object.
   * 2. Call `run_program()`, passing in the parameter object created in the

   *
   * NOTE: Some driver implementations may change the values of some of the
   * parameters recorded in the parameter object (particularly to
   * canonicalize them).
   *
   * Note that `run_program()` is actually a convenience method that wraps
   * `run()` with some code to output the arguments at the beginning and the

  /**
   * A general main application class for use in an application that performs
   * experiments (currently used mostly for experiments in NLP -- i.e. natural
   * language processing -- but not limited to this).  The program is assumed
   * to have various parameters controlling its operation, some of which come
   * from command-line arguments, some from constants hard-coded into the source
   * code, some from environment variables or configuration files, some computed
   * from other parameters, etc.  We divide them into two types: command-line
   * (those coming from the command line) and ancillary (from any other source).
   * Both types of parameters are output at the beginning of execution so that
   * the researcher can see exactly which parameters this particular experiment
   * was run with.
   *
   * NOTE: Although in common parlance the terms "argument" and "parameter"
   * are often synonymous, we make a clear distinction between the two.
   * We speak of "parameters" in general when referring to general settings
   * that control the operation of a program, and "command-line arguments"
   * when referring specifically to parameter setting controlled by arguments
   * specified in the command-line invocation of a program.  The latter can
   * be either "options" (specified as e.g. '--outfile myfile.txt') or
   * "positional arguments" (e.g. the arguments 'somefile.txt' and 'myfile.txt'
   * in the command 'cp somefile.txt myfile.txt').  Although command-line
   * arguments are one way of specifying parameters, parameters could also
   * come from environment variables, from a file containing program settings,
   * from the arguments to a function if the program is invoked through a
   * function call, etc.
   *
   * The general operation of this class is as follows:
   *
   * (1) The command line is passed in, and we parse it.  Command-line parsing
   *     uses the ArgParser class.  We use "field-style" access to the
   *     arguments retrieved from the command line; this means that there is
   *     a separate class taking the ArgParser as a construction parameter,
   *     and containing vars, one per argument, each initialized using a
   *     method call on the ArgParser that sets up all the features of that
   *     particular argument.
   * (2) Application verifies the parsed arguments passed in and initializes
   *     its parameters based on the parsed arguments and possibly other
   *     sources.
   * (3) Application is run.
   *
   * A particular application customizes things as follows:
   *
   * (1) Consistent with "field-style" access, it creates a class that will
   *     hold the user-specified values of command-line arguments, and also
   *     initializes the ArgParser with the list of allowable arguments,
   *     types, default values, etc. `TParam` is the type of this class,
   *     and `create_param_object` must be implemented to create an instance
   *     of this class. Extra validation of command-line arguments and
   *     retrieval of any other parameters is handled inside this class.
   *     Since the class will be executed twice, if may be necessary to
   *     bracket code with 'if (ap.parsedValues)' if it should only execute
   *     when values have been parsed and filled in.
   * (2) `run_program` must, of course, be implemented, to provide the
   *     actual behavior of the application.

   * the parameters appropriately, e.g. from the command line. The parameters
   * themselves are stored in field variables, initialized from the ArgParser
   * object. In order to make this work, the following steps are necessary:

   *     "shadow fields" in this object get initialized, the parser records
   *     the valid parameters and their properties, and initializes the
   *     fields to their default values.
   * <li>Tell the parser to parse a command line.
   * <li>Create a second parameter object the same way the first one was
   *     created. This time, the fields will be initialized to the values
   *     stored in the command line.
   * </ol>
   *
   * If programmatic access is desired and the parameters are to be set
   * in some other way, just  do the first two steps, and then change any
   * parameters that should not have their default values.
