// FUCK ME TO (JAR) HELL! This is an awful hack. Boys and girls, repeat after

// Here the problem is that, as a program increases in size and includes
// dependencies from various sources, each with their own sub-dependencies,
// you'll inevitably end up with different versions of the same library as
// sub-dependencies of different dependencies.  This is the infamous "fragile
// library problem" (aka DLL hell, JAR hell, etc.). Java has no solution to
// this problem. C# does. (As with 100 other nasty Java problems that don't
// exist in C#.)
//
// On top of this, SBT makes things even worse by not even providing a way
// of automatically picking the most recent library.  In fact, it doesn't
// provide any solution at all that doesn't require you to write your own
// code (see below) -- a horrendous solution typical of packages written by
// programmers who are obsessed with the mantra of "customizability" but
// have no sense of proper design, no knowledge of how to write user
// interfaces, and no skill in creating understandable documentation.
// The "solution" below arbitrarily picks the first library version found.
// Is this newer or older?  Will it cause weird random breakage?  Who knows?
